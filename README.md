It's a very simple game that i did in my 2rd grade at University. It's a memory game. Adds as many boxes as you insert, and these boxes have the same number in pairs. When you start the game their numbers disappears and you have to select the boxes that had same numbers. If you fail, you lose; if you succeed you gain points. When you match all boxes, game gives you notification that game is ended.
