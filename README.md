It's a very simple game that i did in my 2rd grade at University. It's a memory game. Adds as many boxes as you entered, and these boxes have the same number in pairs. When you start the game their numbers disappears and you have to select the boxes that had same numbers. If you fail, you lose points, if you succeed you gain it. When you math all boxes game gives you notification that game is ended.
